DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHARED HOSTING (cPanel)
===================================================

1. PREPARE FILES
   - Compress the contents of the 'server' folder into a ZIP file (e.g., server_deploy.zip).
   - Do NOT include the 'node_modules' folder in the zip to keep it small. You will install dependencies on the server.

2. UPLOAD TO CPANEL
   - Go to cPanel > File Manager.
   - Create a folder for your app (e.g., 'fahimo-api').
   - Upload 'server_deploy.zip' to this folder and extract it.

3. SETUP NODE.JS APP
   - Go to cPanel > Setup Node.js App.
   - Click "Create Application".
   - Node.js Version: Choose 18.x or 20.x (Recommended).
   - Application Mode: Production.
   - Application Root: 'fahimo-api' (the folder you created).
   - Application URL: 'api.yourdomain.com' or 'yourdomain.com/api'.
   - Application Startup File: 'server_entry.js' (This file was created for you).
   - Click "Create".

4. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
   - Once created, scroll down to the "Detected configuration file" section.
   - Click "Run NPM Install". This will install all required packages.

5. DATABASE SETUP
   - Go to cPanel > MySQL Databases.
   - Create a new database (e.g., 'username_fahimo_db').
   - Create a new user and assign it to the database with ALL PRIVILEGES.
   - Go to phpMyAdmin.
   - Select your new database.
   - Click "Import" and upload the 'schema.sql' file found in your server folder. This will create all the tables.

6. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (.env)
   - In the Node.js App page in cPanel, look for "Environment Variables".
   - Add the following variables (I have pre-filled your database details):
     
     DATABASE_URL: mysql://mvafrgmy_chat1:Doda%4055002004@localhost:3306/mvafrgmy_chat1
     
     (Note: The '@' in your password was changed to '%40' to work correctly in the URL)

     - JWT_SECRET: (Generate a random long string)
     - PORT: 3001
     - SMTP_EMAIL: mahmoud.a.fouad2@gmail.com
     - SMTP_PASSWORD: (Your Gmail App Password)
     - GROQ_API_KEY: (Your AI API Key)

7. RESTART
   - Click "Restart Application" in the Node.js App page.

8. FRONTEND (CLIENT)
   - The 'client/out' folder contains the static frontend files.
   - Upload the contents of 'client/out' to your 'public_html' folder (or the folder for your main domain).
   - Ensure the frontend is configured to point to your API URL.

GOOD LUCK!
